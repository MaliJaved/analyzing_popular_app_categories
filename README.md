I'm excited to share my latest project, where I delve into the world of mobile apps to uncover trends and patterns behind the most popular ones on the Google Play Store. The primary objective of this project is to help my company create successful free apps that generate revenue through ads and attract a wider audience.

# Metadata
The Google Play Store apps dataset offers a wealth of information that can help drive app development businesses towards success. By extracting actionable insights from this data, developers can better understand the Android market and create apps that cater to user preferences.

# Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It consists of web-scraped data of 10,000 Play Store apps, providing a comprehensive overview of the Android market.

# Dataset Dimensions
The dataset contains a total of 10,841 rows, representing individual apps, and 13 columns, capturing various app attributes: 
1. App (Name): The name of the app as listed on the Google Play Store.
2. Category (App): The primary category under which the app is classified on the Google Play Store.
